## Making a csv or tsv file that will run in cvasl:

We are BIDS compliant, but have even more specification for how files must be organized to work with CVASL. Do not fear- your file can easily be reorganized to fit our format. If you have any problems with this please contact Dr. Candace Makeda Moore (c.moore@esciencecenter.nl) We will even give an examples of how to format files, and how to concatente them in our researcher_interface folder.

Please note, all column names should be exactly the same. We will also add a script to check compliance.
